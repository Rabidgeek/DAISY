# DAISY
Doghouse Artificial Intelligence System Yawps

AI for The DogHouse, with ASL recognition 
Goal: Train DAISY to recognize sign language commands. Starting with simple
commands such as displaying Google Tasks in a window when one signs 'do-do',
opening a window and recording/saving video when one signs 'captain document',
etc. 

More to be documented here later on - this is only the beginning!
